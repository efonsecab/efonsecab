# Executive Summary: Architecture for the Heart and Soul

## A Journey of Synthesis
My professional path represents a harmony between two decades of technical architecture and a calling toward **Psychology**. After 20 years of crafting digital systems as a professional from Costa Rica, I am now transitioning toward a life dedicated to the most vital architecture of all: human connection and self-discovery. In **September 2026**, I will begin the next stage of my formal training in **Madrid** to deepen this expertise.

---

## The Mission: Self-Discovery & Healthy Bonds
My main objective is to help people get to know themselves deeply and establish **healthy, long-lasting relationships**. This mission is rooted in the belief that when we understand our own design, we can better love those around us. 

As a **Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)**, I utilize my sensitivity to see the nuances that technical tools often overlook. I integrate these insights into my book series and my creative services, ensuring that every project is a stewardship of the talents God has provided.

## Character Strengths at the Core
My approach is guided by the signature strengths that define my best self:

* **Humor:** I enjoy bringing smiles to others' faces and using playfulness to make difficult situations more bearable.
* **Spirituality:** My faith and deep sense of purpose shape my conduct and provide comfort during times of challenge.
* **Hope:** I am a future-minded optimist who believes in the goodness of what is to come and sets goals to achieve it.
* **Judgment:** I weigh information thoroughly and look at problems from all angles to find a balanced, accurate viewpoint.
* **Curiosity:** I take an active interest in the mystery of life, always seeking new ways to learn and grow.

## 🛡️ Professional Ethics & Transparency
Please note that while I am a dedicated student of the human experience and will begin formal Psychology studies in **Madrid** in **September 2026**, **I am not a licensed psychologist, nor do I provide clinical therapy or diagnostic services**. My work consists of **educational mentorship and strategic coaching** based on my published works and scientifically validated identity frameworks. If you require mental health treatment, please consult a licensed healthcare professional.
