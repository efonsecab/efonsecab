# Executive Summary: Architecture for the Heart and Soul

[Spanish Version](servicios.md)

## A Journey of Synthesis: Technology, Psychology & Faith
My professional path represents a unique harmony between two decades of digital architecture and a deep-rooted calling toward **Psychology**. While I have spent 20 years crafting complex digital systems, my formal academic journey began in **2012** at the **Universidad Latina de Costa Rica**. I possess over **14 years of passion for psychological study**, having successfully completed the core foundational subjects of the degree.

I am currently transitioning toward a career dedicated to the most vital architecture of all: human connection and self-discovery. Starting **2026**, I will be in **Madrid** to **continue** my formal psychological training and deepen this expertise within a new cultural context.

## The Mission: Self-Discovery & Healthy Bonds
My objective is to leverage my psychological studies and professional experience to help individuals establish **healthy, long-lasting relationships**. I believe that when we understand our own design, we can better love those around us. 

As a **Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)**, I utilize my natural sensitivity to perceive nuances that technical tools often overlook. I integrate these insights into my published works and creative services, ensuring every project is a stewardship of the talents God has provided.

## Character Strengths at the Core
My approach is guided by the signature strengths that define my best self:

* **Humor:** I enjoy bringing smiles to others' faces and using playfulness to make difficult situations more bearable.
* **Spirituality:** My faith and deep sense of purpose shape my conduct and provide comfort during challenges.
* **Hope:** I am a future-minded optimist who believes in the goodness of what is to come.
* **Judgment:** I weigh information thoroughly to find a balanced, accurate viewpoint.
* **Curiosity:** I take an active interest in the mystery of life, always seeking new ways to learn and grow.

## 🛡️ Professional Ethics & Transparency
I have successfully completed **16+ subjects in Psychology**—including Human Development, Psychopathology, and Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches—at the **Universidad Latina de Costa Rica**. I will **continue** my formal Psychology studies in **Madrid** in **September 2026**. 

**I am not yet a licensed psychologist, nor do I provide clinical therapy or diagnostic services.** My work consists of **educational mentorship and strategic coaching** based on my published works and scientifically validated identity frameworks. If you require mental health treatment, please consult a licensed healthcare professional.
